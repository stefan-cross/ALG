 * Prior to this we could build a class to facilitate permutation production as per previous question regarding
 * decision trees. 
 * 
 * * * Use dynamic programming to produce a set of all possible permutations.
 * 
 * Then we can pass the permutations into our networks, compare outputs where all n! are in order
